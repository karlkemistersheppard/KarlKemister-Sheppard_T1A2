# Description of your portfolio website:

### <u>**Purpose**</u>
The purpose of this project was to create a online protfolio that allows potential employers and recruiters to see where my curernt skills are and what i am working on to further my learning in various programming languages.  It also showcases my understanding and design process from the start to finish from mocup stage /wireframes to pushing modifications/ amendments via git functions in terminal.

### <u>**Functionality**</u>
The website was created with one purpose when the project was in the design stage (KISS), keeping things simple yet direct to the point.
One of the main objectives in the design planning was to create a fixed navigation that always sat on the top margin of the device to allow the user to have a easy way to transition across the multiple pages with ease.

Following a generalised structured layout similar to what you expect from most sites today eg footer containing links or achors that allow the user to email, call or connect with directly from the click of a button.


### <u>**Features**</u>

**Responsive Website** that displays across the below displays.
```scss 
@media only screen and (min-width: 320px) and (max-width: 575px)

@media only screen and (min-width: 769px) and (max-width: 992px)
@media only screen and (min-width: 993px) and (max-width: 1900px)

**Advanced SCSS** (Sassy) stylings, with the addition of @mixins, $variables to create dry code where possiable.
Functional Footer that contains links anchor href tags that have Psuedo :hover functions *(Allow user to directly email, call or connect to professional accounts eg Linkedin GitHub)*

**Blog** containers have two element features using box-shadow and color changes with :hover affects.
In addition each blog container class has additional button inside each that will be linked to individual HTML documents that are also styled withing the current theme style, and within these blog pages will be a img for each blog.
